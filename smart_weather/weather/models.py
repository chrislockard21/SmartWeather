# Create your models here.









# Example model
# class Foo(models.Model):
#     # A foreignkey can be used to relate models, so the model Foo will have a
#     # one to many relationship with the user.
#     user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
#     bar = models.CharField(max_length=30)
